An application focused on event viewing("official": created by sponsors, pubs, clubs, etc., "unofficial": created by other users of the application.

The app focuses on events happening in the next 24 hours. Events will always cycle and be replaced by others following this rule. 
One feature could be the addition of a paid option for users which can show events for the whole week, giving them the oportunity to check in for the event earlier.

Events have a either a limited number of “seats” or unlimited, you cannot check in for an event once it is full.
The events can also be filtered, examples: Official/Unofficial, Gym workout, Party, Study, Football etc.

If you are checked in for an event you will be notified before it starts and you also have the option to get notifications if an event that was full has free places now.
